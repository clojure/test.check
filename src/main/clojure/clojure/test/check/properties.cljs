  "Creates a property (properties are also generators). A property
  is a generator that generates the result of applying the function
  under test with the realized arguments. Once realized, the arguments
  will be applied to `function` with `apply`.

  Example:

  (for-all* [gen/int gen/int] (fn [a b] (>= (+ a b) a)))
