# test.check

_test.check_ is a Clojure property-based testing tool inspired by QuickCheck.
The core idea of _test.check_ is that instead of enumerating expected input
and output for unit tests, you write properties about your function that should
hold true for all inputs. This lets you write concise, powerful tests.

_test.check_ used to be called
[_simple-check_](https://github.com/reiddraper/simple-check).

## Examples

Let's say we're testing a sort function. We want to check that that our sort
function is idempotent, that is, applying sort twice should be equivalent to
applying it once: `(= (sort a) (sort (sort a)))`. Let's write a quick test to
make sure this is the case:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.test.check :as tc])
(require '[clojure.test.check.generators :as gen])
(require '[clojure.test.check.properties :as prop])

(def sort-idempotent-prop
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/vector gen/int)]
    (= (sort v) (sort (sort v)))))

(tc/quick-check 100 sort-idempotent-prop)
;; => {:result true, :num-tests 100, :seed 1382488326530}
```

In prose, this test reads: for all vectors of integers, `v`, sorting `v` is
equal to sorting `v` twice.

What happens if our test fails? _test.check_ will try and find 'smaller'
inputs that still fail. This process is called shrinking. Let's see it in
action:

```clojure
(def prop-sorted-first-less-than-last
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/not-empty (gen/vector gen/int))]
    (let [s (sort v)]
      (< (first s) (last s)))))

(tc/quick-check 100 prop-sorted-first-less-than-last)
;; => {:result false, :failing-size 0, :num-tests 1, :fail [[3]],
       :shrunk {:total-nodes-visited 5, :depth 2, :result false,
                :smallest [[0]]}}
```

This test claims that the first element of a sorted vector should be less-than
the last. Of course, this isn't true: the test fails with input `[3]`, which
gets shrunk down to `[0]`, as seen in the output above. As your test functions
require more sophisticated input, shrinking becomes critical to being able
to understand exactly why a random test failed. To see how powerful shrinking
is, let's come up with a contrived example: a function that fails if it's
passed a sequence that contains the number 42:

```clojure
(def prop-no-42
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/vector gen/int)]
    (not (some #{42} v))))

(tc/quick-check 100 prop-no-42)
;; => {:result false,
       :failing-size 45,
       :num-tests 46,
       :fail [[10 1 28 40 11 -33 42 -42 39 -13 13 -44 -36 11 27 -42 4 21 -39]],
       :shrunk {:total-nodes-visited 38,
                :depth 18,
                :result false,
                :smallest [[42]]}}
```

We see that the test failed on a rather large vector, as seen in the `:fail`
key. But then _test.check_ was able to shrink the input down to `[42]`, as
seen in the keys `[:shrunk :smallest]`.

### `clojure.test` Integration

The macro `clojure.test.check.clojure-test/defspec` allows you to succinctly
write properties that run under the `clojure.test` runner, for example:

```clojure
(defspec first-element-is-min-after-sorting ;; the name of the test
         100 ;; the number of iterations for test.check to test
         (prop/for-all [v (gen/not-empty (gen/vector gen/int))]
           (= (apply min v)
              (first (sort v)))))
```

### ClojureScript

ClojureScript support was added in version `0.7.0`.

The first _test.check_ example needs only minor modifications for
ClojureScript:

```clojure
(ns cljs.user
  (:require [cljs.test.check :as tc]
            [cljs.test.check.generators :as gen]
            [cljs.test.check.properties :as prop :include-macros true]))

(def sort-idempotent-prop
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/vector gen/int)]
    (= (sort v) (sort (sort v)))))

(tc/quick-check 100 sort-idempotent-prop)
;; => {:result true, :num-tests 100, :seed 1382488326530}
```

The remaining examples need no further changes with the exception
of `cljs.test` integration.

### `cljs.test` Integration

The macro `cljs.test.check.cljs-test/defspec` allows you to succinctly
write properties that run under `cljs.test`, for example:

```clojure
(defspec first-element-is-min-after-sorting ;; the name of the test
         100 ;; the number of iterations for test.check to test
         (prop/for-all [v (gen/not-empty (gen/vector gen/int))]
           (= (apply min v)
              (first (sort v)))))
```

## Release Notes

Release notes for each version are available in
[`CHANGELOG.markdown`](CHANGELOG.markdown). Remember that prior to version
0.5.7, _test.check_ was called _simple-check_.
